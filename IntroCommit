Introduction:
GitHub is one of the most popular version control platforms that helps developers store, manage, and collaborate on their code. It is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently. GitHub provides a web-based interface and tools that make it easy to manage repositories, branches, and pull requests for collaborative software development.

Details:
GitHub offers powerful features such as repository hosting, issue tracking, pull requests, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Developers can fork projects, contribute through pull requests, and review code changes easily. GitHub also provides options for private repositories, organizations, and teams, making it suitable for both open-source and enterprise projects. The platform integrates well with many third-party tools and supports markdown files for documentation.

Conclusion:
GitHub simplifies teamwork and version control by providing an easy-to-use platform for developers to manage their code. Through branching, merging, and pull requests, teams can collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work. Learning GitHub helps developers understand professional workflows used in real-world software engineering projects, making it an essential tool for modern developers.
