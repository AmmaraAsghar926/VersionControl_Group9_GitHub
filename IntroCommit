Introduction:
GitHub is one of the most popular version control platforms that helps developers store, manage, and collaborate on their code. It is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently. GitHub provides a web-based interface and tools that make it easy to manage repositories, branches, and pull requests for collaborative software development.
