## Syeda Muskan Haider's Contribution (Collaborator Updates)

### Introduction
Hello! I am Syeda Muskan Haider, one of the members working on this project. We are using GitHub because it is the best platform for team collaboration. The main goal of our assignment is to learn how to work on the same code without mistakes. GitHub helps us achieve this by keeping track of every small change we make. This is the first step in learning how to create quality software.
