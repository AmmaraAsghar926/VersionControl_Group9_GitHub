## Syeda Muskan Haider's Contribution (Collaborator Updates)

### Introduction
Hello! I am Syeda Muskan Haider, one of the members working on this project. We are using GitHub because it is the best platform for team collaboration. The main goal of our assignment is to learn how to work on the same code without mistakes. GitHub helps us achieve this by keeping track of every small change we make. This is the first step in learning how to create quality software.
### Details
The Branching feature is the most important part of this assignment. A branch is like a **safe copy** of the main project. When I add my part of the report in my branch, I am not disturbing anyone else's work or the main code. Once I am done, I use a **Pull Request (PR)** to ask our Leader to check my work. This process ensures that we maintain high code quality before merging.
### Conclusion
To conclude, this entire assignment is helping us learn a very important skill called **distributed collaboration**. By making three commits (introduction, details, and conclusion) and creating a pull request, we have understood the complete workflow of a professional project. This practical experience is very useful for using all three platforms: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
